    - References the artistic style and visual elements
    - Connects the viewer to the emotional journey
    - Uses sophisticated but accessible language
    - Feels appropriate for a museum placard

    - "Bold strokes of crimson and amber capture the raw intensity of transformation through life's most challenging moments."
    - "Gentle layers of soft pastels create a sanctuary of peace, inviting quiet reflection on inner resilience."
    - "Dynamic interplay of light and shadow reveals the complexity of human emotion in abstract form."
    - "Ethereal blues and greens evoke the tranquil acceptance found in life's quiet, contemplative moments."

  guidelines:
    - "Keep it to one sophisticated sentence"
    - "Focus on emotional resonance over technical details"
    - "Use art-appropriate vocabulary"
    - "Connect visual elements to emotional themes"
    - "Make it museum-worthy but accessible"
